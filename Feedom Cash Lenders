 Payday lending regulations have come a long way since the industry’s inception. In Feedom Cash Lenders, federal regulators steered conventional banks away from bankrolling payday lenders and toward offering more sustainable “small-dollar loans.” Unlike their payday lending counterparts, these loans can be repaid over longer terms through installments and have much lower initial fees.7 

Currently, there isn’t conclusive evidence to say for certain whether payday lending increases during a recession. However, for a middle- or low-income individual, taking out one of these loans would most likely exacerbate the financial strain they’d already be feeling amid an economic downturn. Regardless of the state of the economy, small-dollar loans and other alternative sources of funding can help minimize consumers’ reliance on risky payday loans.
